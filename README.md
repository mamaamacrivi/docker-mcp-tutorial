## 🖥️ System Requirements
Before you begin, make sure your computer meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS, or a recent version of a Linux distribution.

- **Storage:** At least 5 GB of free space.
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading the necessary files.

## 📂 Download & Install
To download the tutorial materials, visit the following page:

3. Once you are in the correct directory, run the command to start setting up:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
